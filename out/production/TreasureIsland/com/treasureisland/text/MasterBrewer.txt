-- This is the first thing I did, went straight to the master brewer.
-- I asked him " Can I get a sample of the Sunshine Rum"
-- MB - "You need what!" he replied with little surprised look on his face.
-- I repeated, can have some Sunshine rum?
-- MB grumbled something under his breath and disappeared for 10- 15 minutes,leaving me confused.
-- Finally he came back, gave me a clear looking liquid in a shot glass and asked me to drink up!
-- I looked at the shot glass and then back at MB, he was still staring at me!
-- I thought, whatever and drank up. I glanced at MB after taking the shot and he was still straining at me.
-- I finally asked, "Is that it?"
-- He kept staring at me for little more.
-- Then he finally passed me a envelop and said "I don't know how you know Great Joe but he told me to give this to the person asking for Sunshine Rum."
-- Received an envelop with a map inside. This is what we were looking for. Clues to the next island.
