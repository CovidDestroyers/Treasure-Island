In the manager's creepy old room.
	-- The first thing I noticed is the big painting straight in front of the door.
	-- Found a piece of paper with a title " Summon B" and instructions for summoning something!
Summon the brewers' ghost.
	-- I guess that's what the paper I found was for.
	-- I performed the instructions . . .
	    -- Nothing happens.
