Isla DM

	1) Abandoned house on the hill.
		a) Room with flickering light.
			-- This room is in the front of the house.
			-- The first thing you notice about this house is the flickering light inside of the room.
			-- Inside the house, I found that the flickering light was because of tons of broken mirrors in the house reflecting light into that particular room. Pretty weird!
			-- Searched the room for few hours and found . . .
				--Nothing, other than shimmering lights.
		b) Upstairs room with red hand prints on the door.
			-- Blood, these hand prints are of blood. What happened here?
			-- I was right about hand prints, as there was more dried of blood on floor.
			-- The room also hit you square in the jaw with its awful and foul smell.
			-- But I persisted and searched the room. I found a shirt dirty and with dried blood all over it. . .
			 -- but hidden underneath the collar was a small little key!
		c) Bathroom with dripping water noise.
			-- Mouldy, musty and slippery.
			-- There is no way I am going in there.
				-- Found nothing.
		d) In the dark attic.
			-- This is the last place I wanna be at.
			-- I was able to find a candle in the kitchen and it came in real handy to search the attic.
			-- Attic also had a very foul and decaying smell. I found . . .
			-- A skeleton! For observation it seem like the person was crawling towards the north corner of the attic.
			-- Examining the corner I found a key hole!
			-- The curved key I found fit perfectly into the lock. Inside I  . . .
				-- Found a gem!

	2) Graveyard
		a) Search near the grave with the biggest tombstone.
			-- This Island keeps getting better and better.
			-- The grave I was looking to find was pretty easy to find.
			-- The dug the grave and found . . .
			--Nothing!
			-- In my frustration I pushed against the tombstone and it moved a little!
			-- I pushed it a little more and it pushed out a small wooden box at the bottom of the tombstone.
			-- I found . . .
				-- coins +196
		b) By the grave with the smallest tombstone.
			-- This was little harder to find.
			-- I searched both the grave and the tombstone. I found . . .
			-- Nothing! Other than a creepy sound of a muffled sigh when I uprooted the tombstone.
		c) Search the abandoned caretaker's quarters.
			--
		d) Dig up the grave of legendary pirate Tumtum.

	3) Dusk till Dawn Saloon
		a) Speak with drunk Sam Sr.
			-- Talking with Sam Sr. didn't reveal much.
			-- He was just talking about his son being a very good man and he is really proud of him.
				-- Got nothing.
		b) Check the wine cellar.
			-- This was easy, their wine cellar is accessible to public. You pick you bottle and and pay at the counter. Futuristic!
			-- But what could I possibly find here? after much observation and exploring around I found . . .
				--  . . .out that the tip I received to check this place was a waste of time.
				-- Got nothing.
		c) Knock out John, to steal the key hanging from around his neck.
			-- From the information I gathered, this is one of the keys that I need.
			-- So I fought John and I got . . .
				-- A key and health -50
		d) Flirt with Isabella to find out more information.
			-- Once again my charm came to the rescue. Flirting revealed . . .
				-- a guy named John could have more information for me.

	4) Pawpaw beach park
		a) Look for a clue near Pawpaw's statue.
			-- Pawpaw was a local legend. He was a merchant and adventurer. He was also believed to be a treasure hunter.
			-- It is also believed that he also has more information/key or I need.
			-- I explored around the statue area and found . .
				-- Nothing
		b) Win the top prize labelled "Key" at the balloon shooting carnival game.
			-- This could be a total waste. Local legend Pawpaw is supposed to have provided with an odd, big ornate key to the Carnival which run every Saturday and Sunday.
			-- That key is displayed as a first prize and a very tough shooting game.
			-- No one has won it yet, or should I say that no one has been interested in winning an ornamental key. But I have a hunch.
			-- After trying and failing to get the key for weeks. I got . . .
				-- A key, I finally got the key and became a little bit of local legend myself.
		c) Win the hot-dog eating competition to beat Slimjaw. Slimjaw has some useful information.

				-- Info to search Pawpaw museum.
		d) Pawpaw beach park museum.
			--Interesting museum, Pawpaw donated lot of stuff for this museum.
				-- But I found out nothing interesting here.
