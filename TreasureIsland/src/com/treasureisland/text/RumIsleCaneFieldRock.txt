-- Under the big rock.
	-- It took a day to scout the field, but I was able to find the biggest rock.
	-- I didn't notice anything unusual around the bottom of this huge rock.
	-- Should I look again?
	-- I still found no sign of anything unusual near the bottom of rock but i didn't notice a small carving near the very bottom of the stone, an inch or so above the ground.
	-- The carving looked like a scarecrow.
	-- Found nothing else.
