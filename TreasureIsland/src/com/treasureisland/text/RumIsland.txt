Rum Island

	1) Rum distillery
		a) Left corner of the store house.
				-- I applied for the position for store manager, to gain access to the property.
				-- I checked the left corner of the store house as soon as I got a chance.
				-- There was a nothing unusual about the place other than the small patch on the wall,
				   like it was fixed.
				-- I poked at the patch and it caved in a little bit. I looked inside and found . . .
					-- Nothing!

		b) Under the cask marked 9999.
				-- I am sure I will find something interesting there. I am sure of it.
				-- I looked under the cask as soon as I got the chance and I found . . .
				  -- A snake!!
		c) At the bottom of the open cask by the main door.
				-- I don't even remember as to how I got this clue!
				-- But I can't ignore any clues. This treasure hunting is not easy.
				-- As soon as I got the chance, I inconspicuously got to the main the door.
				-- I checked the open cask and I could not see anything.
				-- I put my hand into the cask to check the bottom of the cask with murky smelly liquid!
				-- I felt something at the bottom of cask, I pull it out . . .
				-- It was a small sack of coins!
					-- Coins + 20
		d) Ask master brewer for the Sunshine Rum sample.
				-- This is the first thing I did, went straight to the master brewer.
				-- I asked him " Can I get sample of Sunshine Rum"
				-- MB - "You need what!" he replied with little surprised look on his face.
				-- I repeated, can have some Sunshine rum?
				-- MB grumbled something under his breath and disappeared for 10- 15             			minutes,leaving me confused.
				-- Finally he came back, gave me a clear looking liquid in a shot glass and asked me to drink up!
				-- I looked at the shot glass and then back at MB, he kept staring at me!
				-- I thought, whatever and drank up. I glanced at MB after taking the shot and he was still straining at me.
				-- I finally asked, "Is that it?"
				-- He kept staring at me for little more.
				-- Then he finally passed me a envelop and said "I don't know how you know Great Joe but he told me to give this to the person asking for Sunshine Rum."
					-- Received an envelop with a map inside.
