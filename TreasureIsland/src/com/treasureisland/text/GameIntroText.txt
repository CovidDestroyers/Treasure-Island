I know you said you put this life behind you, but rumor has it Black Beard has a bounty on your head!!
Don't worry friend, I have a way to satisfy the bounty.....if you survive his gang!!

All you need to do is find the diamond.

Playing this game is easy, talk to people around the Islands, Sail between the Islands and walk between
the places.

The clues will lead you on your path.  If you ever get disorientated, type Map and it will clear your way.
